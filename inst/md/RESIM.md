## Restrictive Eigen Selection Index Method (RESIM).

RESIM is a generalization of ESIM to the case in which are incorporated restrictions on $Y ={\rm{\bf{\beta} 'p}$ , the procedure for set the ${\rm{\bf \beta}}$ is, therefore, very similar to ESIM and is based on IS restricted Kempthorne and Nordskog (1959). So, suppose you have $q$ variables and phenotypic want to improve the means of $q-r$ of them while $r$ of them 
average remain unchanged, the index $Y ={\rm{\bf{\beta}'p}}$ should maximize $\rho_{YZ}^2$ under conditions tale. Again, the restrictions are introduced by the matrix ${\rm{\bf W}}$ of 0s and 1s, where 1s indicate that the mean values of the variables Phenotypic remain unchanged, while indicating 0s average changes in phenotypic variables, such that ${\rm{\bf{W}'G \beta}} ={\rm{\bf 0}}$. Let ${\rm{\bf C}} ={\rm{\bf GW}$, since $\rho_{YZ}$ is invariant under changes of scale can be assumed which ${\rm{\bf{\beta}'P \beta}} = 1$ and ${\rm{\bf{\theta}'G \theta}}=1$ , so $\rho_{YZ}^2$ be maximized under the constraints  ${\rm{\bf{\beta}'C}} ={\rm{\bf 0}}$, ${\rm{\bf{\beta}'P \beta}} = 1$ and  ${\rm{\bf{\theta}'G \theta}}=1$. Let $\mu$, $\omega$ and ${\rm{\bf {v}'}}=\left [{v_1 ... v_r} \right]$ Lagrange multipliers. It should maximized 
\[ 
\Phi = \left ({{\rm{\bf{\theta} 'G \beta}}} \right) ^ 2 - \mu \left ({{\rm{\bf 
{\beta} 'P \beta}} -1} \right) - \omega \left ({{\rm{\bf{\theta}' G \theta 
-1}}} \right) -{\rm{\bf{v} '{C}' \beta}} 
\]
In deriving $\Phi$ over ${\rm{\bf \beta}}$, ${\rm{\bf \theta }}$, $\mu$, $\omega$, and ${\rm{\bf{v} '}}=\left [{v_1 ... v_r} \right]$, Ceron-Rojas {et al}. (2008a) showed that 
\[ 
({\rm{\bf Q}} - \omega{\rm{\bf I}}){\rm{\bf \beta}} ={\rm{\bf 0}} 
\]
where now ${\rm{\bf Q}} = [{\rm{\bf I}} -{\rm{\bf P}}^{-1}{\rm{\bf C}} ({\rm{\bf{C}'P}}^{-1}{\rm{\bf C}}) ^{-1}{\rm{\bf{C}'}}]{\rm{\bf 
P}}^{-1}{\rm{\bf G}}$. Thus, RESIM, the value that maximizes $\rho_{YZ}^2$ under the constraint ${\rm{\bf{\beta}'P \beta}} = 1$, ${\rm {\bf{\theta}'G \theta}} = 1$ and ${\rm{\bf{\beta}'C}} ={\rm{\bf 0}}$ is the first eigenvalue ($\omega$) of the matrix ${\rm{\bf Q}}$ , and the vector lets build resim $Y={\rm{\bf{\beta}'p}}$ (with maximum correlation with $Z={\rm{\bf{\theta}'g}})$ is the first eigenvector (${\rm{\bf \beta}}$) matrix ${\rm{\bf Q}}$

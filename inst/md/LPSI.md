#### Linear Phenotypic Selection Index LPSI (Smith).

In 1936, Smith developed the methodology for the selection simultaneously on several variables based on the phenotypic linear combination of

$Y = \beta'p$
$Z = \theta'g$

Where $\bold{Y}$ is the selection index (SI),$\bold{p} = [p_{1} , p_{2},\ldots, p_{q}]$ and $\beta = [b_{1}, b_{2},\ldots, b_{q}]$ is the vector of values Phenotypic and the coefficient vector of $\bold{{Y}}$ respectively, $\bold{{Z}}$ denotes the breeding value or 
net genetic component that can be gained through various selection cycles, $\bold{g} = [g_{1}, g_{2}, \ldots, g_{q}]$ is the vector of values genotypic, and $\theta = [\theta_{1}, \theta_{2},\ldots, \theta_{q}]$ is the vector of economic weights, which according to Smith 
(1936), can be determined according to the experience of researchers and is regarded as a vector of constants. With the aim establish the relationship between phenotypic values $P_{j}$ $(j = 1, 2,\ldots, q)$ observable and unobservable genotype in (Smith, 1936) proposed the following model 

$P_{j} = g_{j} + \epsilon_{j}$ 

Where $\bold{g}_{j}$ is the genotypic value of the jth feature and $\bold{\epsilon }_{j}$ is the environmental component, which affects the genotypic character. (Smith, 1936) assumes that the interactions between $\bold{g}_{j }$ and $\bold{\varepsilon }_{j}$ can be considered as a random effect, therefore $\bold{g}_{j}$ has only additive effects such as $\bold{Z} =\theta'\bold{g}$ denotes the breeding value (Hazel, 1943; Kempthorne and Nordskog, 1959), under these assumptions, selection based on $\bold{Y}= \beta'\bold{p}$ leads to a response to selection (R) equal to 

$R=k \sigma_Z \rho_{YZ}=k \sigma_Z \frac{\bold{\theta}' \Sigma \beta}{\sqrt{\bold{\theta}'\Sigma\theta}\sqrt{\bold{\beta}'S\beta}}$

Where $\bold{\Sigma}$ and $\bold{S}$ are matrices variance-covariance matrix for phenotypic and genotypic values, 
respectively, $\bold{k}$ is the standard differential selection, $\bold{\theta}'\Sigma \beta}$ is the covariance between SI and the breeding value, $\sigma^2_Z=\bold{\theta}'\Sigma\theta}$ is the variance of $\bold{Z}$ and $\sigma^2_Y=\bold{\beta}'S \beta}$ is the variance of SI, $\bold{\rho}_{YZ}$ is the correlation between SI and the breeding value. In the Smith selection index $\bold{\beta}_{s}=\bold{S}^{-1}\bold{\Sigma\theta}$ (where the subscript $\bold{S}$ denotes the method of Smith, $\bold{S}^{-1}$ is the inverse of the variance-covariance matrix of phenotypic $\bold{S}$) allows us to construct the selection index, $Y =\bold{\beta}_{s}\bold{'p}$, which maximizes the correlation with the breeding value.
